# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create Modular Broker Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an abstract broker interface to support multiple brokers.
# Details:
Define an AbstractBroker class with standard methods for order management, position queries, and balance management. Implement adapters for Binance and Interactive Brokers. Include a paper trading simulator that mimics real trading behavior.

# Test Strategy:
Test the broker interface with mock data to ensure correct order execution and position management.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design AbstractBroker Base Class [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the abstract base class defining the standard broker interface with all required methods and properties
### Details:
Define AbstractBroker as an abstract base class with abstract methods for order placement (place_order, cancel_order, modify_order), position management (get_positions, get_position), account queries (get_balance, get_account_info), market data (get_quote, get_orderbook), and connection management (connect, disconnect, is_connected). Include proper type hints, docstrings, and error handling specifications. Define standard data classes for Order, Position, Balance, and AccountInfo.

## 2. Implement Paper Trading Simulator [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop a paper trading broker implementation that simulates realistic trading behavior with configurable parameters
### Details:
Create PaperTradingBroker class inheriting from AbstractBroker. Implement simulated order execution with configurable slippage models (fixed, percentage, market impact), realistic fill simulation based on order book depth, position tracking with P&L calculation, balance management with margin requirements, and order state management (pending, filled, cancelled, rejected). Include configurable latency simulation and partial fill support. Store execution history for analysis.

## 3. Create Binance Exchange Adapter [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement the Binance broker adapter supporting both testnet and production environments
### Details:
Develop BinanceBroker class implementing AbstractBroker interface. Integrate with Binance REST API for order management and account queries, WebSocket streams for real-time updates, and handle API rate limiting with automatic throttling. Implement order type mapping (market, limit, stop-loss, take-profit), position calculation from balance changes, error handling with automatic retry logic, and support for both spot and futures trading. Include testnet/production environment switching.

## 4. Develop Interactive Brokers Adapter [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create the Interactive Brokers adapter with support for multiple asset classes and paper trading
### Details:
Implement InteractiveBrokersBroker class using ib_insync library. Handle IB Gateway/TWS connection management with automatic reconnection, implement order routing for stocks, futures, and forex, manage IB's asynchronous API with proper event handling, track positions across multiple accounts, handle market data subscriptions and throttling. Include contract search and validation, commission tracking, and support for complex order types (bracket, trailing stop).

## 5. Build Broker Factory and Configuration System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Create a factory pattern for broker instantiation with comprehensive configuration management
### Details:
Implement BrokerFactory class with dynamic broker selection based on configuration. Create YAML-based configuration system for broker settings, credentials management with environment variable support, connection parameters, and trading rules. Include broker health monitoring with automatic failover, performance metrics collection (latency, success rate), and unified error handling across all broker implementations. Add broker-specific configuration validation and testing utilities.
