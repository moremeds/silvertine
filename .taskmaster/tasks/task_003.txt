Implement configuration management to allow easy addition of new brokers without code changes.
<info added on 2025-07-21T07:33:59.503Z>
Implement detailed implementation specifics for the BrokerFactory pattern as follows:

1. **Dynamic Configuration Loading**:
   - Utilize YAML configuration files with environment variable substitution.
   - Template: `config/exchanges/broker_template.yaml` with ${BROKER_TYPE}, ${API_KEY} patterns.
   - Include broker-specific sections for credentials, connection, trading, and risk_limits.

2. **BrokerRegistry Pattern**:
   - Implement registry-based broker discovery using `BrokerRegistry.get(config.broker_type)`.
   - Enable auto-registration of broker implementations via decorators.
   - Support plugin-style broker loading from external modules.

3. **Configuration Validation**:
   - Use Pydantic models for type-safe configuration validation.
   - Ensure required field validation occurs before broker instantiation.
   - Implement broker-specific validation methods (e.g., validate_binance_config, validate_ib_config).

4. **Factory Implementation**:
   ```python
   class BrokerFactory:
       async def create_broker(self, name: str) -> AbstractBroker:
           config = await self._load_config(name)
           broker_class = BrokerRegistry.get(config.broker_type)
           broker = broker_class(self.event_bus, config)
           await broker.initialize()
           return broker
   ```

5. **Environment Integration**:
   - Support .env files for broker credentials.
   - Implement production-safe secret management patterns.

Implement comprehensive error handling and reconnection logic as follows:

1. **Connection State Management**:
   - Implement `ConnectionState` enum: `DISCONNECTED`, `CONNECTING`, `CONNECTED`, `ERROR`, `RECONNECTING`.
   - Track connection health with heartbeat mechanisms.
   - Automatic state transitions with proper logging.

2. **Retry Patterns with Exponential Backoff**:
   ```python
   async def place_order_with_retry(self, order: OrderEvent) -> str:
       max_retries = 3
       for attempt in range(max_retries):
           try:
               return await self.place_order(order)
           except RateLimitError:
               await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)
           except ConnectionError:
               await self.reconnect()
   ```

3. **Error Classification System**:
   - **Recoverable Errors**: `RateLimitError`, `TemporaryConnectionError`, `TimeoutError`.
   - **Non-Recoverable Errors**: `AuthenticationError`, `InsufficientFundsError`, `InvalidOrderError`.
   - **Critical Errors**: `AccountSuspendedError`, `ExchangeMaintenanceError`.

4. **WebSocket Reconnection Logic**:
   - Automatic reconnection with progressive backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 60s).
   - Listen key refresh for Binance user data streams.
   - Connection health monitoring with ping/pong frames.
   - Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascade failures.

5. **Error Reporting and Monitoring**:

   - Error metrics collection (error counts by type).
   - Alert system for critical connection failures.
   - Health check endpoints for external monitoring.

6. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Fallback to cached data when live feeds fail.
   - Order queue persistence during disconnections.
   - Failover between multiple data sources.
   - Emergency stop mechanisms for critical failures.

7. **Recovery Strategies**:
   - State reconciliation after reconnection.

   - Position synchronization with broker APIs.
   - Order status verification post-reconnection.
