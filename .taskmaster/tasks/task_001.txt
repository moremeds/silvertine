# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Initialize the project repository with a clear structure for the trading system.
# Details:
Create a Git repository with the following structure: /src for source code, /tests for test cases, /docs for documentation, and /configs for configuration files. Include a README.md file with project overview and setup instructions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository structure and ensure README.md contains correct setup instructions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Git Repository and Base Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Git repository and establish the foundational directory structure for the Silvertine trading system
### Details:
Initialize a new Git repository using 'git init'. Create the base directory structure: /src for Python source code, /tests for pytest test cases, /docs for technical documentation, and /config for configuration files (note: renamed from /configs to match CLAUDE.md specification). Add a .gitignore file with Python-specific exclusions including __pycache__, *.pyc, .env, venv/, and cache/ directory. Create empty __init__.py files in src/ and tests/ directories to establish Python package structure.

## 2. Create Comprehensive README.md with Project Overview [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Write a detailed README.md file that serves as the primary entry point for developers working with the Silvertine trading system
### Details:
Create README.md in the repository root with the following sections: Project name and description emphasizing event-driven architecture and quantitative trading focus. Features section highlighting asyncio event bus, multi-exchange support (Binance testnet, Interactive Brokers), real-time TUI interface, and paper trading capabilities. Technology stack overview including Python 3.11+, Redis Streams, SQLite, Textual framework, and FastAPI. Quick start guide with installation steps, environment setup, and basic usage examples. Project structure explanation mapping to the created directories. Development workflow section referencing TaskMaster integration. Links to further documentation in /docs directory.

## 3. Setup Python Project Configuration and Dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Establish Python project configuration with dependency management and development environment setup
### Details:
Create pyproject.toml file for modern Python project configuration with project metadata including name='silvertine', version='0.1.0', and Python requirement >=3.11. Define core dependencies: asyncio, redis, sqlalchemy, textual, fastapi, websockets, pydantic. Add development dependencies: pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, black, mypy, ruff. Create requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt for pip compatibility. Add setup.py for backwards compatibility if needed. Create .python-version file specifying 3.11 for pyenv users. Initialize virtual environment setup instructions.

## 4. Configure Development Tools and Git Hooks [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Set up development tooling for code quality, formatting, and automated checks
### Details:
Create .pre-commit-config.yaml for pre-commit hooks including black for code formatting, ruff for linting, mypy for type checking, and conventional commit message validation. Add pytest configuration in pyproject.toml with test paths, coverage targets (75% as specified), and asyncio settings. Create .editorconfig for consistent code formatting across different editors. Setup GitHub Actions workflow template in .github/workflows/ci.yml for continuous integration. Add Makefile with common development commands: make test, make lint, make format, make install. Configure VS Code settings in .vscode/settings.json for Python development.

## 5. Initialize Configuration and Documentation Templates [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Create initial configuration structure and documentation templates aligned with project requirements
### Details:
Create /config directory structure with subdirectories: environments/, exchanges/, strategies/, risk/, logging/, database/, security/, monitoring/. Add example configuration files: config/environments/development.yaml.example, config/exchanges/binance_testnet.yaml.example with rate limit settings placeholders, config/exchanges/interactive_brokers.yaml.example with connection parameters. Create /docs directory with initial documentation structure: architecture.md for system design, api.md for API documentation template, deployment.md for deployment guide template, development.md for development workflow. Add .env.example file in root with all required environment variables documented but not populated. Ensure cache/ directory is created but empty, with proper .gitignore entry.
