# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Security and Compliance Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 9, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build comprehensive security infrastructure for API authentication, encryption, audit logging, and access controls to ensure secure communication with exchanges and regulatory compliance.
# Details:
Implement JWT-based authentication system using PyJWT library with RS256 algorithm for API endpoints. Create a centralized secret management service using python-dotenv for development and AWS Secrets Manager/HashiCorp Vault integration for production environments. Store all sensitive credentials (BINANCE_TESTNET_API_KEY, BINANCE_TESTNET_SECRET_KEY, IB_GATEWAY_CREDENTIALS) securely with encryption at rest. Implement end-to-end encryption for all exchange communications using TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning for Binance and IB Gateway connections. Create comprehensive audit logging system that tracks all trading activities, API calls, configuration changes, and risk events with structured JSON format including timestamp, user/system identifier, action type, request/response data, and outcome. Store audit logs in separate secure storage with retention policies (90 days minimum). Implement rate limiting using Redis-based token bucket algorithm with configurable limits per endpoint (e.g., 10 requests/second for trading endpoints, 100 requests/second for market data). Create IP whitelisting functionality with dynamic management interface, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses with CIDR notation. Implement request signing for exchange APIs using HMAC-SHA256 for Binance and IB's proprietary signing mechanism. Add security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security) to all API responses. Create security monitoring dashboard showing authentication failures, rate limit violations, and suspicious activities. Implement automatic security incident response with configurable actions (alert, temporary block, full system shutdown). Ensure all security measures comply with financial industry standards including PCI DSS principles for handling sensitive financial data.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive security test suite using pytest-security plugin. Test JWT authentication by generating valid and invalid tokens, verifying expiration handling, and testing token refresh flow. Validate secret management by ensuring no hardcoded secrets exist in codebase using tools like detect-secrets and truffleHog. Test encryption implementation by intercepting network traffic with mitmproxy and verifying all exchange communications are encrypted. Validate audit logging by performing various trading operations and verifying complete audit trail with no missing events, checking log integrity and tamper-evidence. Test rate limiting by sending burst requests exceeding limits and verifying appropriate 429 responses with Retry-After headers. Test IP whitelisting by attempting connections from allowed and blocked IPs, including IPv6 addresses. Perform penetration testing using OWASP ZAP to identify common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF). Test security incident response by simulating various attack scenarios (brute force authentication, DDoS attempt) and verifying automatic responses. Validate compliance by running automated compliance checks against audit logs ensuring all required fields are present and properly formatted. Perform 24-hour security stress test monitoring for any security violations or bypasses.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement JWT Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a JWT-based authentication system using the PyJWT library with RS256 algorithm for API endpoints.
### Details:
Ensure that the authentication system can generate, validate, and refresh tokens securely.

## 2. Create Centralized Secret Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a centralized secret management service using python-dotenv for development and integrate AWS Secrets Manager/HashiCorp Vault for production.
### Details:
Store sensitive credentials securely with encryption at rest and ensure no hardcoded secrets exist in the codebase.

## 3. Implement End-to-End Encryption [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up end-to-end encryption for all exchange communications using TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning for Binance and IB Gateway connections.
### Details:
Ensure that all communications are encrypted and secure against man-in-the-middle attacks.

## 4. Develop Audit Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive audit logging system that tracks trading activities, API calls, and configuration changes.
### Details:
Logs should be structured in JSON format and stored securely with retention policies of at least 90 days.

## 5. Implement Rate Limiting and IP Whitelisting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up rate limiting using a Redis-based token bucket algorithm and create IP whitelisting functionality with dynamic management.
### Details:
Rate limits should be configurable per endpoint, and the IP whitelisting should support both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
