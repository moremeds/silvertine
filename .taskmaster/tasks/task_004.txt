# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Multi-Source Data Aggregation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a data aggregation system that supports multiple data sources.
# Details:
Create an AbstractDataSource class to handle both historical and real-time data. Implement caching mechanisms to reduce API calls by over 80%. Ensure data quality checks are in place to handle missing and anomalous values.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct integration tests to verify data aggregation from multiple sources and validate data quality checks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design AbstractDataSource Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the abstract base class and interface for all data sources with standardized methods for both historical and real-time data retrieval
### Details:
Define abstract methods for connect(), disconnect(), get_historical_data(), subscribe_realtime(), validate_data(), and handle_errors(). Include data transformation interfaces to normalize data from different sources into a common format. Design the interface to support async operations and proper error handling.

## 2. Implement Redis-Based Caching Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Build a comprehensive caching mechanism using Redis to store and retrieve market data efficiently, reducing API calls by over 80%
### Details:
Implement cache key generation strategies based on symbol, timeframe, and data type. Design TTL policies for different data types (real-time vs historical). Create cache warming strategies for frequently accessed data. Implement cache invalidation logic for stale data. Add metrics to track cache hit/miss ratios and API call reduction.

## 3. Create Data Quality Validation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop comprehensive data quality checks to identify and handle missing values, outliers, and anomalous data points
### Details:
Implement validation rules for price data (non-negative, within reasonable bounds), volume data (non-negative integers), and timestamp consistency. Create anomaly detection using statistical methods (z-score, IQR) for price movements. Design handling strategies for missing data (forward fill, interpolation, or rejection). Add data quality metrics and logging for monitoring data integrity.

## 4. Build Multi-Source Aggregation Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Create the core aggregation engine that combines data from multiple sources, handles conflicts, and maintains data consistency
### Details:
Implement priority-based source selection for conflicting data. Design data fusion algorithms for combining overlapping datasets. Create timestamp alignment mechanisms for sources with different update frequencies. Build connection pooling and failover logic for source reliability. Implement aggregation strategies (latest value, weighted average, consensus) based on data type.

## 5. Implement Concrete Data Source Adapters [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Create concrete implementations of AbstractDataSource for Binance and Interactive Brokers with proper rate limiting and error handling
### Details:
Build BinanceDataSource with WebSocket support for real-time data and REST API for historical data. Implement IBDataSource using ib_insync for Interactive Brokers integration. Add rate limiting logic respecting exchange-specific limits. Include reconnection logic with exponential backoff. Implement data normalization to convert exchange-specific formats to common internal format.
