# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement High-Precision Backtesting Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a backtesting engine to simulate historical trading scenarios.
# Details:
Ensure the backtesting engine shares the same strategy code and risk management modules as live trading. Implement cost simulation for fees, slippage, and market impact. Generate detailed performance reports with over 15 metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Run backtests on historical data and compare results with expected outcomes to validate accuracy.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Strategy Code [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure the backtesting engine uses the same strategy code as the live trading system.
### Details:
Review and integrate the existing strategy codebase into the backtesting engine to maintain consistency with live trading.

## 2. Implement Risk Management Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Incorporate the same risk management modules used in live trading into the backtesting engine.
### Details:
Adapt the existing risk management modules to work seamlessly with the backtesting engine, ensuring accurate risk assessments.

## 3. Cost Simulation Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop cost simulation features for fees, slippage, and market impact.
### Details:
Create algorithms to simulate trading costs accurately, reflecting real market conditions during backtests.

## 4. Performance Report Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Generate detailed performance reports with over 15 metrics.
### Details:
Design a reporting module that compiles performance data from backtests and presents it in a user-friendly format.

## 5. Backtest Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run backtests on historical data and compare results with expected outcomes.
### Details:
Establish a validation process to ensure the backtesting engine produces accurate and reliable results.
