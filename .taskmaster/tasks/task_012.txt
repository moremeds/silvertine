# Task ID: 12
# Title: Deployment and Infrastructure Automation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 10, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build comprehensive deployment infrastructure including Docker containerization, environment configuration, CI/CD pipeline setup, monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana, and production deployment automation.
# Details:
Create multi-stage Dockerfile for Python 3.11+ application with separate build and runtime stages to minimize image size. Configure docker-compose.yml for local development with services for the trading system, PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB for time-series data, Redis for caching, and monitoring stack. Implement environment-specific configuration using python-dotenv with .env.example template containing all required variables (BINANCE_TESTNET_API_KEY, IB_GATEWAY_HOST, etc.). Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with workflows for testing (pytest with coverage), linting (black, flake8, mypy), security scanning (bandit, safety), and Docker image building/pushing to registry. Configure Kubernetes manifests using Helm charts for production deployment with ConfigMaps for environment variables, Secrets for API keys, HorizontalPodAutoscaler for scaling based on CPU/memory metrics, and health check probes. Implement monitoring infrastructure with Prometheus for metrics collection (custom metrics via prometheus_client), Grafana dashboards for visualization (trading performance, system health, resource usage), AlertManager for critical alerts (drawdown limits, connection failures), and log aggregation using Fluentd/Elasticsearch. Create deployment automation scripts using Ansible or Terraform for infrastructure provisioning on AWS/GCP/Azure, with support for blue-green deployments and automated rollback capabilities. Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures including automated database backups to S3/GCS, configuration state management, and documented recovery procedures. Ensure security best practices with non-root container user, secrets management via HashiCorp Vault or cloud KMS, network policies for pod-to-pod communication, and TLS encryption for all external endpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Docker build process by running 'docker build -t silvertine:test .' and checking image size is under 500MB. Test local development environment with 'docker-compose up' and verify all services start successfully with health checks passing. Validate CI/CD pipeline by pushing test branch and confirming all GitHub Actions workflows complete successfully including test coverage >75%, linting passes, and Docker image is pushed to registry. Test Kubernetes deployment in staging environment by applying Helm charts and verifying pods are running, services are accessible, and autoscaling triggers correctly under load. Verify monitoring setup by generating test metrics and confirming they appear in Prometheus (query rate(http_requests_total[5m])) and Grafana dashboards display correctly. Test alerting by triggering threshold breaches and confirming notifications are sent via configured channels (email/Slack/PagerDuty). Perform disaster recovery drill by simulating database failure and executing recovery procedures to restore within RTO of 1 hour. Conduct security audit using tools like Trivy for container scanning and ensure no critical vulnerabilities are present. Load test production deployment with simulated trading activity to verify system handles 1000 events/second with <100ms latency as per performance requirements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Multi-Stage Dockerfile [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a multi-stage Dockerfile for the Python 3.11+ application to optimize image size by separating build and runtime stages.
### Details:
Ensure the Dockerfile minimizes the final image size while maintaining all necessary dependencies for the application to run.

## 2. Configure docker-compose.yml [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a docker-compose.yml file for local development, including services for the trading system, PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB, Redis, and monitoring stack.
### Details:
Ensure all services are correctly defined and can communicate with each other as expected.

## 3. Implement Environment Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use python-dotenv to implement environment-specific configuration with a .env.example template containing all required variables.
### Details:
Ensure that the application can load environment variables correctly for different environments.

## 4. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create GitHub Actions workflows for testing, linting, security scanning, and Docker image building/pushing.
### Details:
Ensure that the CI/CD pipeline runs all necessary checks and builds the Docker image correctly.

## 5. Configure Kubernetes Manifests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create Kubernetes manifests using Helm charts for production deployment, including ConfigMaps, Secrets, and HorizontalPodAutoscaler.
### Details:
Ensure that the deployment is scalable and secure, with proper health checks in place.
