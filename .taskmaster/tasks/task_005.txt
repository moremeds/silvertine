# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Strategy Development Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a standardized framework for strategy development.
# Details:
Implement the AbstractStrategy class that provides an interface for strategy logic. Include support for Bar-based and Tick-based strategies. Provide built-in performance metrics for strategy evaluation.

# Test Strategy:
Create example strategies and validate their performance metrics against known benchmarks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement AbstractStrategy Base Class [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core AbstractStrategy base class that defines the interface and common functionality for all trading strategies
### Details:
Design the AbstractStrategy class with abstract methods for on_bar(), on_tick(), on_signal(), on_fill(), and calculate_signals(). Include common properties like name, symbols, timeframe, and position tracking. Implement base functionality for logging, error handling, and strategy lifecycle management (initialize, start, stop, reset). Define standardized interfaces for accessing market data, account information, and placing orders through the broker interface.

## 2. Implement Bar-based Strategy Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop specialized support for strategies that operate on completed price bars (candlesticks) with various timeframes
### Details:
Create BarStrategy class inheriting from AbstractStrategy with specialized on_bar() implementation. Support multiple timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d) with automatic bar aggregation from tick data. Implement bar series management with configurable lookback periods and rolling window calculations. Add technical indicator integration points for common indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands). Include bar-specific utilities like pattern recognition helpers and price action analysis tools.

## 3. Implement Tick-based Strategy Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop specialized support for high-frequency strategies that react to individual price ticks and order book changes
### Details:
Create TickStrategy class inheriting from AbstractStrategy with specialized on_tick() implementation. Support level 2 market data processing including bid/ask spreads and order book depth. Implement tick buffering and aggregation for micro-structure analysis. Add latency-sensitive features like tick-by-tick position tracking and immediate order placement. Include utilities for spread analysis, volume profile tracking, and market microstructure metrics.

## 4. Build Strategy Performance Metrics System [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive performance measurement and reporting system for strategy evaluation
### Details:
Implement StrategyMetrics class to calculate real-time and historical performance metrics including returns (total, annualized, risk-adjusted), Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, maximum drawdown, win rate, profit factor, and average trade duration. Add trade-level analytics tracking entry/exit prices, holding periods, and P&L attribution. Create metric aggregation for multi-asset strategies with correlation analysis. Implement performance attribution to identify profit sources (market timing, asset selection, position sizing).

## 5. Create Example Strategies and Strategy Templates [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Develop reference implementations demonstrating framework usage and serving as templates for custom strategies
### Details:
Implement MovingAverageCrossover strategy as a simple bar-based example with configurable fast/slow periods. Create MeanReversionStrategy using Bollinger Bands for range-bound markets. Develop a TickScalpingStrategy demonstrating high-frequency tick processing. Build a MultiAssetMomentum strategy showing portfolio-level position management. Include comprehensive documentation, parameter optimization examples, and backtesting configurations for each strategy.
