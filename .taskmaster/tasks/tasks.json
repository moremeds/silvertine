First, implement event ordering and sequencing guarantees to ensure that events are processed in the correct order. Next, develop backpressure and flow control mechanisms to manage the rate of event processing and prevent system overload. Additionally, create an event priority system to handle critical events more efficiently. Implement high-precision time synchronization to ensure accurate event timing, which is crucial for high-throughput trading applications. Finally, optimize memory management to handle large volumes of events without degrading performance. Consider using data structures that minimize memory overhead and improve access times. Document the design decisions and any trade-offs made during implementation.",
