# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Event-Driven Core Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core event-driven engine using asyncio and Redis Streams.
# Details:
Utilize Python's asyncio library to create an event loop. Implement Redis Streams for event persistence and replay. Define four core event types: MarketDataEvent, OrderEvent, FillEvent, SignalEvent. Ensure events are processed in order and are idempotent.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for event handling and integration tests to verify event persistence and replay functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Event System Architecture and Base Classes [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational event system architecture with abstract base classes and interfaces for the four core event types (MarketDataEvent, OrderEvent, FillEvent, SignalEvent) using Python's asyncio library.
### Details:
Define abstract base Event class with common attributes (event_id, timestamp, event_type). Create concrete event classes for MarketDataEvent (symbol, price, volume, bid/ask), OrderEvent (order_id, symbol, direction, quantity, order_type), FillEvent (order_id, symbol, executed_qty, executed_price, commission), and SignalEvent (symbol, signal_type, strength, strategy_id). Implement event serialization/deserialization methods for Redis persistence. Use dataclasses or Pydantic models for type safety and validation.

## 2. Implement Redis Streams Integration Layer [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop the Redis Streams integration layer for event persistence, including connection management, stream creation, and event publishing/consuming mechanisms.
### Details:
Create RedisStreamManager class to handle Redis connection pooling using aioredis. Implement methods for creating streams (one per event type), publishing events with XADD command, consuming events with XREAD/XREADGROUP, and managing consumer groups. Add connection retry logic with exponential backoff. Implement event replay functionality using XRANGE for historical event retrieval. Configure Redis persistence settings (AOF/RDB) for durability.

## 3. Build Asyncio Event Bus Core [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Implement the central asyncio-based event bus that coordinates event flow between components, ensuring ordered processing and idempotent event handling.
### Details:
Create EventBus class using asyncio.Queue for in-memory event buffering. Implement publish() and subscribe() methods with topic-based routing. Add event handler registration with priority support. Ensure FIFO ordering within each event type using separate queues. Implement idempotency by tracking processed event IDs in a time-windowed cache. Add circuit breaker pattern for failing handlers. Create event processing metrics (throughput, latency, error rates).

## 4. Develop Event Processing Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Create the event processing pipeline that consumes events from Redis Streams and routes them through the asyncio event bus to registered handlers.
### Details:
Implement EventProcessor class that bridges Redis Streams and the asyncio event bus. Create separate asyncio tasks for each event stream consumer. Implement backpressure handling to prevent memory overflow. Add event transformation and validation before routing. Implement dead letter queue for failed events. Create event processing checkpoints for recovery. Add graceful shutdown handling with in-flight event completion.

## 5. Implement Event Monitoring and Replay System [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Build comprehensive event monitoring, debugging tools, and replay functionality for historical event processing and system recovery.
### Details:
Create EventMonitor class for real-time event flow visualization and metrics collection. Implement event replay coordinator that can replay events from specific time ranges or event IDs. Add replay speed control (real-time, accelerated, or step-by-step). Create event filtering capabilities for replay (by type, symbol, or custom predicates). Implement event audit trail with full event history. Add Prometheus metrics export for event processing statistics.

## 6. Implement Event Ordering and Sequencing Guarantees [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Design and implement strict event ordering mechanisms to ensure tick-by-tick data integrity for high-frequency trading scenarios
### Details:
Create sequence number generation for all events with monotonic incrementing. Implement event buffering mechanism to handle out-of-order arrivals due to network latency. Design a sliding window approach to reorder events based on timestamps and sequence numbers. Add event ordering validation layer to detect and report sequence gaps. Implement configurable ordering policies (strict vs best-effort) based on event type. Ensure FIFO processing within each event type queue while maintaining cross-queue dependencies.

## 7. Implement Backpressure and Flow Control Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Create comprehensive backpressure handling to manage market data bursts and prevent system overload during high-volume trading periods
### Details:
Implement adaptive queue sizing with dynamic limits based on system resources. Create producer throttling mechanism using async semaphores and rate limiting. Design consumer feedback system to signal upstream components when queues reach capacity. Implement load shedding strategies for non-critical events during extreme conditions. Add configurable buffer sizes with overflow policies (drop oldest, drop newest, block). Create metrics for queue depth monitoring and backpressure events. Implement circuit breaker pattern for automatic recovery from overload situations.

## 8. Implement Event Priority System and Critical Path Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Create a multi-tier priority system to ensure critical trading events (orders, fills) are processed before less critical events (market data) during high-load scenarios
### Details:
Design priority levels: CRITICAL (order operations), HIGH (risk events), NORMAL (market data), LOW (monitoring). Implement priority-aware event queues with separate processing lanes for each priority tier. Create fast-track processing path for critical events bypassing normal queues. Add preemption mechanism to pause low-priority processing for critical events. Implement dynamic priority elevation based on event age and business rules. Design priority inheritance to prevent priority inversion issues. Add configurable priority mappings for different trading strategies and market conditions.

## 9. Implement High-Precision Time Synchronization System [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create microsecond-precision timestamping with NTP synchronization for accurate event sequencing and latency measurement in high-frequency trading
### Details:
Implement high-resolution timer using time.perf_counter_ns() for nanosecond precision. Create NTP client integration for clock synchronization with configurable NTP servers. Design timestamp hierarchy: hardware timestamp, kernel timestamp, application timestamp. Implement clock drift detection and compensation algorithms. Add monotonic clock guarantees to prevent time reversals. Create latency measurement framework tracking event journey through system. Implement time zone handling with all timestamps in UTC.
