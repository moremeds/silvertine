# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Configuration Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a centralized configuration management system that organizes all settings under config/ directory with environment-specific support, validation, and secure credential handling.
# Details:
Create a hierarchical configuration structure under config/ directory following best practices for Python applications. Implement config/base.py as the main configuration module using Pydantic for type validation and environment variable support. Structure configuration files as: config/environments/{development,staging,production}.py for environment-specific settings, config/exchanges/{binance,interactive_brokers}.py for exchange API configurations, config/strategies/default.py for strategy parameters, config/risk.py for risk management thresholds and limits, config/logging.py for logging configuration using Python's logging.config.dictConfig, and config/database.py for database connection settings. Use python-dotenv to load environment variables from .env files with a comprehensive .env.example template. Implement a ConfigManager class that merges base configuration with environment-specific overrides, validates all configuration values using Pydantic models, supports dynamic reloading of configuration without system restart, encrypts sensitive values in memory using cryptography library, and provides type-safe access to configuration values throughout the application. Create configuration schemas for each module: ExchangeConfig with fields for api_key, secret_key, testnet flag, rate limits; StrategyConfig with parameters, indicators, timeframes; RiskConfig with position_limit, max_drawdown, stop_loss_percentage; DatabaseConfig with connection strings, pool settings, timeout values. Implement configuration validation that checks required fields are present, validates numeric ranges (e.g., 0 < stop_loss < 1), ensures API keys match expected patterns, validates URLs and connection strings, and provides clear error messages for misconfiguration. Support configuration precedence: environment variables override file settings, environment-specific files override base configuration, and runtime updates override static configuration. Include helper functions for getting typed configuration values, checking if running in production/development, safely accessing nested configuration, and exporting configuration for debugging.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive test suite for configuration management using pytest. Test configuration loading by creating test config files in tests/fixtures/config/, verifying correct precedence when environment variables override file settings, and ensuring invalid configurations raise appropriate ValidationError. Test environment-specific loading by mocking different environments (development, staging, production) and verifying correct files are loaded and merged. Validate configuration schema enforcement by testing Pydantic models reject invalid types and values, required fields raise errors when missing, and numeric constraints are enforced (e.g., risk percentages between 0-1). Test secure credential handling by ensuring sensitive values are never logged or exposed in error messages, encryption/decryption works correctly for stored secrets, and environment variables are properly sanitized. Create integration tests that verify configuration is correctly injected into broker connections, strategy initialization uses correct parameters, and risk management respects configured limits. Test configuration reloading by modifying config files and verifying changes are detected, ensuring system components receive updated configuration, and validating no service interruption occurs during reload. Verify configuration export functionality masks sensitive values, provides complete configuration tree for debugging, and maintains proper JSON/YAML formatting. Performance test configuration access to ensure sub-millisecond lookup times for frequently accessed values and minimal memory overhead for configuration storage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Base Configuration Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement config/base.py as the main configuration module using Pydantic for type validation and environment variable support.
### Details:
This module will serve as the foundation for the configuration management system, ensuring that all configurations are validated and loaded correctly.

## 2. Structure Configuration Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Organize configuration files under config/ directory for different environments and modules.
### Details:
Create the necessary configuration files for environments (development, staging, production) and specific modules (exchanges, strategies, risk, logging, database).

## 3. Implement ConfigManager Class [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2
### Description: Develop a ConfigManager class that merges base configuration with environment-specific overrides and supports dynamic reloading.
### Details:
This class will handle the merging of configurations, validate values, and provide type-safe access to configuration throughout the application.

## 4. Configuration Validation Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Implement validation logic to check required fields, numeric ranges, and patterns for API keys and URLs.
### Details:
Ensure that all configuration values are validated correctly and provide clear error messages for misconfigurations.

## 5. Environment Variable Support and Encryption [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Integrate python-dotenv for loading environment variables and implement encryption for sensitive values in memory.
### Details:
This will ensure that sensitive information is handled securely and that environment variables can override file settings.
