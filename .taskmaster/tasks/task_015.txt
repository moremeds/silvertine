# Task ID: 15
# Title: Create Web-Based User Interface for Silvertine Trading System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a responsive web-based user interface for the Silvertine trading system using FastAPI for the backend and a modern frontend framework with WebSocket support for real-time trading updates.
# Details:
Implement a web interface using FastAPI as the backend framework and React for the frontend. The interface should support real-time updates through WebSocket connections to display live trading data and user interactions. Ensure the design is responsive for mobile access, utilizing CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling. Integrate existing API endpoints from Task 9 to facilitate user actions such as placing trades, viewing account information, and monitoring market data. Implement state management in the frontend using tools like Redux or Context API to manage application state effectively. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms are in place for a smooth user experience.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct usability testing to ensure the interface is intuitive and responsive across devices. Verify WebSocket connections are established and data is updated in real-time by simulating trading events. Perform integration tests to ensure all API endpoints are functioning correctly and returning expected data. Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library for frontend testing, and Postman for API endpoint verification.
