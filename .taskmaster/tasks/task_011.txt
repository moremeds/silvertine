# Task ID: 11
# Title: Establish Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build a complete testing framework implementing TDD methodology with unit, integration, stability, and performance testing capabilities targeting 75% code coverage.
# Details:
Set up pytest as the primary testing framework with pytest-asyncio for async code testing. Configure pytest-cov for coverage reporting with HTML and terminal output formats. Implement test structure following src/tests/{unit,integration,stability,performance} organization. Create base test fixtures for event bus, mock brokers, and simulated market data. Establish continuous integration with GitHub Actions running tests on every commit. Implement test data factories using factory_boy for consistent test object creation. Configure tox for testing across multiple Python versions (3.11, 3.12). Set up pytest-benchmark for performance testing with configurable thresholds. Create stability test harness using pytest-timeout and memory_profiler for 8-24 hour runtime validation. Implement integration test containers using testcontainers-python for database and message queue testing. Configure hypothesis for property-based testing of critical components. Establish mocking strategy using unittest.mock and pytest-mock for external dependencies. Create custom pytest plugins for trading-specific assertions and test utilities. Set up parallel test execution with pytest-xdist for faster feedback. Implement test categorization with pytest markers (@pytest.mark.unit, @pytest.mark.integration, @pytest.mark.slow). Configure pre-commit hooks running pytest and coverage checks. Establish performance baselines for event processing (<100ms) and order execution (<500ms). Create automated test report generation with allure-pytest for detailed test analytics.

# Test Strategy:
Verify pytest installation and configuration by running 'pytest --version'. Create sample unit tests for core components (Event, EventBus, AbstractStrategy) achieving >75% coverage. Run integration tests against test doubles of Binance and IB interfaces. Execute 8-hour stability test monitoring memory usage stays below 1GB. Benchmark event processing achieving <100ms latency for 1000 events/second. Validate coverage reporting shows line, branch, and function coverage metrics. Test CI pipeline triggers on git push and blocks merge on test failure. Verify performance tests fail when thresholds are exceeded. Confirm test isolation with no shared state between test runs. Validate parallel execution reduces test suite runtime by >50%. Test that pre-commit hooks prevent commits with <75% coverage. Verify all test categories can be run independently with markers. Confirm test reports generate actionable insights for failed tests.
