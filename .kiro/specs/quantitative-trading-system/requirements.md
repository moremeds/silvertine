# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a lightweight, event-driven quantitative trading and backtesting system designed for mid-to-low frequency (non-HFT) trading strategies. The system addresses the core problems of complex traditional trading architectures, code reuse barriers between backtesting and live trading, and the lack of lightweight but comprehensive quantitative trading solutions. The target users are individual quantitative traders, small hedge funds, and quantitative research teams who need a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective automated trading solution.

The system will provide an integrated platform supporting both real-time trading and historical backtesting through a unified event-driven architecture, enabling seamless strategy development and deployment with high reliability (>99.5% uptime) and low latency (<100ms event processing).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Event-Driven Core Engine

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want a high-performance event-driven core engine, so that I can process market events in real-time with minimal latency and ensure reliable order execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a market data event is received THEN the system SHALL process it within 100ms
2. WHEN an event is published to the event bus THEN the system SHALL guarantee at-least-once delivery to all subscribers
3. WHEN the system processes events THEN it SHALL maintain event ordering for each symbol
4. WHEN an event processing failure occurs THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL support event replay from the last checkpoint
6. WHEN multiple events are queued THEN the system SHALL implement backpressure control to prevent memory overflow

### Requirement 2: Multi-Source Data Management

**User Story:** As a strategy developer, I want unified access to multiple data sources, so that I can develop robust strategies without worrying about data source specifics and ensure data reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting market data THEN the system SHALL support multiple timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 1d)
2. WHEN data is received from external sources THEN the system SHALL validate data quality and handle missing values
3. WHEN the same data is requested multiple times THEN the system SHALL achieve >80% cache hit rate to reduce API costs
4. WHEN a data source becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to backup sources
5. WHEN historical data is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve and cache it within 2 seconds
6. WHEN real-time data is received THEN the system SHALL normalize it to a standard format before distribution

### Requirement 3: Strategy Development Framework

**User Story:** As a quantitative researcher, I want a standardized strategy development framework, so that I can quickly implement and test new strategies with guaranteed code reuse between backtesting and live trading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing a new strategy THEN the system SHALL provide an AbstractStrategy base class with standard event handlers
2. WHEN a strategy is implemented THEN it SHALL work identically in both backtesting and live trading environments
3. WHEN a strategy generates a signal THEN the system SHALL process it through the same risk management pipeline in both modes
4. WHEN strategy parameters are modified THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading without system restart
5. WHEN a strategy encounters an error THEN the system SHALL isolate the failure and continue running other strategies
6. WHEN multiple strategies are running THEN the system SHALL support at least 10 concurrent strategies

### Requirement 4: High-Precision Backtesting Engine

**User Story:** As a strategy developer, I want accurate historical backtesting capabilities, so that I can validate strategy performance and minimize the gap between backtesting and live trading results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running a backtest THEN the system SHALL achieve >1000x real-time speed
2. WHEN calculating performance metrics THEN the system SHALL include at least 15 standard metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, etc.)
3. WHEN simulating trades THEN the system SHALL accurately model transaction costs, slippage, and market impact
4. WHEN backtesting completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report with visualizations
5. WHEN the same backtest is run multiple times THEN the system SHALL produce identical results (reproducibility)
6. WHEN backtesting large datasets THEN the system SHALL handle at least 1 year of 1-minute data without memory issues

### Requirement 5: Modular Broker Integration

**User Story:** As a trader, I want seamless integration with multiple brokers, so that I can execute trades across different platforms without changing my strategy code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to a broker THEN the system SHALL support both paper trading and live trading modes
2. WHEN an order is placed THEN the system SHALL track its status through the complete lifecycle (pending, filled, cancelled)
3. WHEN switching between brokers THEN strategies SHALL continue to work without code modifications
4. WHEN a broker connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection within 30 seconds
5. WHEN rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent throttling to prevent API violations
6. WHEN orders are executed THEN the system SHALL update positions and balances in real-time

### Requirement 6: Risk Management System

**User Story:** As a fund manager, I want comprehensive risk management controls, so that I can protect capital and ensure compliance with risk limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a position exceeds predefined limits THEN the system SHALL automatically reject new orders in that direction
2. WHEN portfolio drawdown reaches the maximum threshold THEN the system SHALL halt all trading activities
3. WHEN risk metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL update them in real-time with <1 second latency
4. WHEN a stop-loss is triggered THEN the system SHALL execute the protective order within 500ms
5. WHEN emergency conditions are detected THEN the system SHALL provide a manual emergency stop mechanism
6. WHEN risk events occur THEN the system SHALL log all events with timestamps for audit purposes

### Requirement 7: User Interface System

**User Story:** As a trader, I want intuitive user interfaces for monitoring and control, so that I can oversee my trading operations and intervene when necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the TUI interface THEN the system SHALL display all critical information on a single screen
2. WHEN market data updates THEN the interface SHALL refresh within 1 second without flickering
3. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN it SHALL be responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
4. WHEN viewing performance data THEN the system SHALL provide real-time charts and metrics
5. WHEN manual intervention is needed THEN the interface SHALL support quick actions via keyboard shortcuts
6. WHEN system alerts occur THEN the interface SHALL provide visual and audio notifications

### Requirement 8: System Reliability and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust monitoring and fault tolerance, so that I can ensure 24/7 system availability and quick issue resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL maintain >99.5% uptime over any 30-day period
2. WHEN a component fails THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation rather than complete shutdown
3. WHEN system metrics exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate alerts within 1 minute
4. WHEN the system restarts THEN it SHALL recover to the last known state within 2 minutes
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging and audit purposes
6. WHEN running continuously THEN the system SHALL pass 7-day stability tests without memory leaks or performance degradation
